    A little about me: <strong>I'm an engineer by trade who's been hacking with computers since the late ’90s.</strong> I created this website to share my story and my projects.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">
    I live in Petaluma, California, after years of moving across the country for new opportunities. Since arriving in the USA in 2016, <strong>I’ve become a big fan of hiking, camping, and exploring nature</strong>, along with the struggle and reward that come with it. Photography grew naturally from that experience.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">
    <strong>My most monetizable skill is coding. I can build products and talk to users.</strong> I did a lot of programming for Intel for about nine years. Then, I cofounded ExplainDev, a AI devtool startup that helped people understand somebody else's code. I’ve also worked with computer vision models to solve real-world factory problems for enterprise customers. 
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">
    <strong>Most of the code I write today is in TypeScript and some Python. I have solid experience as a full-stack developer, have been a database admin, mentor to junior devs, a hackathon winner, cloud operator</strong>, and overall, a sparker of new projects. On the machine learning side, I’ve worked with different model architectures and modalities both locally and in the cloud.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">
    Today, I'm building software that nurtures my curiosity of exploring nature and the way I document it with my camera.
