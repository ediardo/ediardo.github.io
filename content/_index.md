<p style="text-align: justify;">A little about me: <strong>I’ve been hacking with computers since the late ’90s</strong>. I’ve been through a lot since then—dead-slow dial-up connections, the rise of PHP, working in Big Tech, startups, and AI agents. Whew!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>My most monetizable skill is building products and talking to users</strong>. I did a lot of programming for Intel for about nine years, then for ExplainDev, a startup I co-founded in 2021, and most recently for Roboflow, a computer vision startup where I helped customers understand and use CV in their processes. For the last five years, I’ve been on the practical side of AI, focusing on its usefulness and limitations. I’m optimistic that technology improves lives, and it’s my duty to work toward that.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Most of the code I write today is in TypeScript and some Python. I have solid experience as a full-stack developer, have been a database admin, mentor to junior devs, a hackathon winner, cloud operator</strong>, and overall, I’m very comfortable starting new projects. On the machine learning side, I’ve worked with CNNs and LLMs both locally and in the cloud. I understand how they work and how to make them work for me.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, I'm building software that nurtures my curiosity of exploring nature and the way I document it with my camera.</p>
