I'm an engineer from Mazatlán, Mexico, who started coding young and took on small cash tech projects as a teenager, like building websites and fixing computers.

While studying Computer Engineering at university, I started working at Intel in Guadalajara, where I spent nine years in software and cloud development. In 2016, I transferred to San Antonio, Texas, to take part in a collaborative effort between Intel and Rackspace to build OpenStack, an open-source cloud platform aimed at competing with major providers.

In 2020, I left Intel to found a developer tools startup called Explaindev, which grew to over 15,000 users, gained paying customers, and raised over $100K in pre-seed funding. After closing the startup, I joined Roboflow as a Field Engineer, helping companies use computer vision in their factories.

Today, I'm working on an smart assistant for photographers.
