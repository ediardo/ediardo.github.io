  A little about me: <strong>I'm an engineer by trade who's been hacking with computers since the late '90s.</strong> I created this website to share my story, photos, and my projects.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">
  I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazatl%C3%A1n" target="_blank">Mazatlán, México</a> and now live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petaluma,_California" target="_blank">Petaluma, California</a>, after years of moving across the country for new opportunities. Since arriving in the USA in 2016, <strong>I've become a big fan of hiking, camping, and exploring nature</strong>. <a href="/photos">Photography grew naturally from that experience</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">
  <strong><a href="/resume">I can program, build products, and talk to users.</a></strong> The boldest choice I've made in my career is founding a startup, where I got to learn a lot about the value of solving problems for people.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2;">
  <strong><a href="/resume">Most of the code I write today is in TypeScript and Python</a></strong>. I have solid experience as a full-stack developer, have been a mentor to junior devs, a hackathon winner, cloud operator, and overall, a sparker of new projects.</strong> On the machine learning side, I work with different model architectures and modalities both locally and in the cloud.

  Today, <a href="https://www.linkacam.com" target="_blank">I'm building Linkacam</a>, a tool that helps nature photographers spend more time outdoors and less time in front of their computer.
