I’m an engineer from Mazatlán, Mexico, who started coding young and built early tech projects as a teen. After earning a Computer Engineering degree, I spent nine years at Intel in software and cloud development before transferring to San Antonio, Texas, to help build OpenStack with Rackspace. In 2020, I left Intel to pursue a developer tools startup, co-founding Explaindev, which grew to over 15,000 users, secured paying customers, and raised more than $100K in pre-seed funding. After closing the startup, I joined Roboflow as a Field Engineer, helping companies adopt computer vision in their factories.
